We need the request object to get the user, so we'll slightly modify the
existing django.contrib.auth.get_user method. To do so we update the
auth middleware to point to our overridden method.

Calling the "patch_middleware_get_user" method somewhere like our urls.py
file takes care of hooking it in appropriately.
